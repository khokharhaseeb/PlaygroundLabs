i used regex to find words in list and then perform the solution
solution 1
    1) I used list.count funciton in dict comprehention to calculate occurance.

solution 2
    1) I used dictionary for calculatting occurances as dictionary cannot have same keys with differnt values.
    2) I use for loop to iterated and check for the occurance if already in dictioary key then it will be incremented by 1
    other wise list word will be the key and 1 will be its value.
